# Title of decision: Practice async

# Objectives
- keep counter of active connections
- using async in background print each 2 sec number of active connections

# Takeaway
- print() with twice \r, this is smart  `print(f"\r{' ' * 80}\rActive conn. {self.conn_counter}", end="")`

## Status
What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, trying it out, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?
- 001 - draft with sync print
- 003 - trying to implement async Server method print_conn

## Decision
What is the change that we are proposing and/or doing?
- Add atribute: int, conn_couter to Server class
- inc/dec self.conn_counter in handle_conn method
- in tcp client need to add sleep before close connection to see effect on server side

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Options Considered
Options considered, including pros and cons of each.  
Option in "decision" should be included.
- can I mix coroutine with normal fn ? how this two will behave ?
- does async + selectors have any pitfalls?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
